Merkle Tree

Introduction
############

A Merkle tree is a binary tree [link to definition] built using hash pointers [link to definition]. 

Motivation
##########
We want to build a data structure that:

1. Can store lots of data (in our case, **claims**)
2. Makes it easy to prove that some data exists (**proof of membership**)
3. Allows us to check that data hasn't been altered (**tamper resistance**)

It turns out that Merkle trees satisfy these three properties.

Description
###########

Before we take a closer look at the above properties, let's go through how to build a Merkle tree given some data.

Suppose we have a number of blocks containing data. And that these blocks make up the leaves of our tree.

The first step is to group these data blocks into pairs.

Then for each pair of blocks, we build a data structure that has two hash
pointers, one to each block.

In other words, the hash of each block is stored in a parent node. And these parent nodes make up the next level of the tree.

Next, the parent nodes are in turn grouped in pairs, and their hashes stored one level up the tree.

We continue doing this until we reach a single block, the root of the tree.

Tamper resistance
#################

To understand why Merkle trees are tamper resistant, letâ€™s look at what happens if an
adversary wants to tamper with a data block.

If an adversary tampers with some block down here.

[insert image]

That will cause the hash pointer that's one level up to not match.

[insert image]

So she'll have to tamper with that.

[insert image]

Which means, she'll have to tamper with the hash pointer one level up from there.

[insert image]

And so on.

Eventually she'll get up to the top, where she won't be able to tamper with the hash pointer that we've remembered.
