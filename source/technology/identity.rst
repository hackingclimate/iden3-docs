At iden3, our goal is to democratize identity. We believe that everyone should be empowered to become their own certification authority.

What do we mean by identity?

An identity can be a person, a company, an organization, a DAO, a government. An identity can even be a thing: a chair, a room, a bot...

When we talk about identities we are referring to identities as accounts.

Generally speaking, accounts are going to be smart contracts. So **you can think of identities as smart contracts**, where the address of the contract is the identifier of that identity.
