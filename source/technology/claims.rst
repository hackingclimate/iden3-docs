Claims
######

An `identity <https://iden3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technology/identity.html>`_  can provide a claim. You can think of a claim as a statement: something an identity is saying.

Most of the time, these statements refer to other identities. In other words **claims usually create relations between identities.**

For example, when a university (identity) says that a student (identity) has a degree, this is a statement (or a claim) about the student. This statement creates a relation between the student and the university.

It turns out that almost anything we say or do can be thought of as a claim. Company invoices, facebook likes, email messages, can all be thought of as claims.

As you can see from the examples above, **claims can be public or private.**

More examples of claims:

- A certificate (e.g. birth certificate)

- A debt recognition

- An invoice

- An instagram "Like"

- An endorsement (reputation)

- An email

- A driving license

- A role in a company

As you can see, a claim can be almost anything!
