Claims
######

An `identity <https://iden3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technology/identity.html>`_  can provide a claim. You can think of a claim as a statement: something an identity is saying.

Most of the time, these statements refer to other identities. In other words **claims usually create relations between identities.**

For example, when a university (identity) says that a student (identity) has a degree, this is a statement (claim) about the student. This statement creates a relation between the student and the university.

**Claims can be public or private.** And it turns out that almost anything we say or do can be thought of as a claim. Company invoices, Facebook likes, email messages, can all be thought of as claims.
