Zero Knowledge
##############

*In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x.* `Source <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof>`_ 

Zero-knowledge proofs allow us to prove something without revealing unnecessary information.

For our purposes, when we are talking about claims, sometimes we want to prove things in a private way.

For example, say you want to enter a nightclub, and you need to prove to the bouncer that you are over 18. But you don't want to reveal to him your name, address, or anything else that's not relevant.

With a zero-knowledge proof you can prove that you hold the key that belongs to an identity that the state says is over 18, without revealing anything else about that identity.

Non-reusable proofs
###################

A non-reusable proof is a received proof that is not valid to send to a third identity.

For example, imagine that you belong to a politcal party...


How does this work?
