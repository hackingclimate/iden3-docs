Iden3 Developer Portal
========================

Welcome to the Iden3 developer portal. Here you'll find eveything you need to get started building with Iden3.

************************************
What is Iden3 and what are its aims
************************************

Iden3 is an open source project offering a complete decentralized identity management solution over the public blockchain. It is designed with four fundamental goals in mind:

**Enable Self Sovereign Identities**, whereby identities are created, owned and controlled by the user.

**Accessibility**, by promoting the development of open standards and ease of use.

**Scalability**, by minimizing the number of accesses to the blockchain that identity management and claim processing requires.   

**Privacy by design** by using Zero Knowledge Proofs to prove claims without revealing any information other than the validity of the claim.
